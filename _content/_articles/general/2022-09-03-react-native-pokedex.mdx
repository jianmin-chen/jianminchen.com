title: Building a Pokedex with React Native in an hour!
---

Let's build a Pokedex with React Native in one hour! You don't need to know any React Native befor going through this, but you will need the following:

* JavaScript + React
* A computer + a phone. If you don't have a phone on handy to test out the Pokedex, you can use an emulator provided either by Android Studio or one provided by XCode to view your creation.

Let's get started!
