title: Geeking out over specs
---

When I started programming, I was using a Dell Inspiron 15 from 2013. I have upgraded since, thankfully. Currently, I am writing this on an [HP Victus 15](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-victus-15-6-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i5-12450h-8gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1650-512gb-ssd-mica-silver/6503849.p?skuId=6503849) with the following specs:

* Intel i5-12450H, with 8 cores, 12 threads running up to 4.4GHz when overclocked (which I haven't actually tried out, as ~3 GHz is good enough for me)
* 8GB RAM, not including 4GB RAM that I added, for a total of 12GB
* NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 with 4GB
* 512GB SSD
* 15" screen

My Dell Inspiron was 15 inches too, but can't live up to Victus in any way (think: Intel i3 with 4 cores running up to 1.92GHz, 4GB RAM, integrated graphics, and a 240GB HDD). It was bought in 2013 somewhere in the range of $500 - $600. I bought my laptop, including the add-on RAM, for ~$594 total, including tax. Isn't that absolutely insane? Moore's law definitely has been put into perspective for me. The only con for me is that I can't run [Hackintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackintosh) on it since the GPU isn't compatible.

I actually have a custom desktop too that I built sometime last summer. I salvaged the monitor, an extremely old HP monitor from 2005 or 2006 (somewhere in that time range - aka when I was born) that I found outside in somebody's yard with the sign "FREE" next to it. The keyboard is also salvaged - I got it for free from my school's IT workshop since they were getting new keyboards. So I ended up shelling out around ~$800 for the rest of the components:

* The case, a [Cooler Master](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q8VJ17J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1) case for ~$45 (I just checked again and it's $70, what the f**k? Inflation, my man)
* The CPU, a [AMD Ryzen 5](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07STGGQ18/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) with 6 cores, 12 threads running up to 3.6GHz for ~$130 (thankfully, only $140)
* 8GB of [RAM](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WMSJGS1/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s03?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for ~$50 (checked and it's only $38 now)
* The GPU, a [NVIDIA GeForce GTX 710](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073SWN4ZM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1) with 2GB for ~$105 (just checked and it's only $89, the graphics card market is cooling down at least)
* The SSD, a 240GB SSD from [Kingston](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5IB20Q/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s03?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for ~$35 (only $22 right now)

## Software

Okay, software. I've jumped between a bunch of different operating systems over the course of the last two years. On my old Dell Inspiron, I used Windows 8 and 8.1, but you know what? They suck as much as Windows 11.
