title: Taking a look at my earlier learning goals.

Okay, so I didn't make the most progress learning in terms of the stuff that I explicitly defined in my earlier post. However, I think the magic of that post is that I actually did end up learning some of the stuff in there. It's sort of a urge in the right direction, I guess. With that being said, here are my now updated learning goals:

* TypeScript
* Testing libraries in JavaScript (I'm thinking Jest)
