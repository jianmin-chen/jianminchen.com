title: I don't have typical role models.
---

One of the questions people tend to ask other people a lot, or at least in icebreakers, is who their role models are.

Most people typically say someone great, someone that most people will know. Maybe their role models align with their values, like Abraham Lincoln or Frederick Douglass. Maybe their role models have accomplished great things, like Neil Armstrong.

I don't have typical role models. I'm inspired by people you've probably never heard of before in your day-to-day life. These people include:

* [Zach Latta](https://zachlatta.com/), who founded Hack Club.
* Or people like [Linus Lee](https://thesephist.com/), who goes under the Internet persona of @thesephist and wrote his own programming language and various productivity tools with that language for personal reasons and not for ulterior ones.
* What about [Kent Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/), or [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)? Amazing software engineers who write absorbing content that I love reading. Who are absolutely awesome teachers and wrote some of the most important, life-changing tutorials I've read.
* George Hotz is amazing - he built his own DIY auto-driving system. If that's not cool, I don't know what is.

These are the people that I look up to. People that create and build things. They don't have to be well known. Your role models don't have to, either.
