I've been thinking over these and listening to Taylor Swift (as usual). What can I say? Listening to Taylor Swift for three hours straight is very conducive to my thinking, especially since her new album, *Midnights*, came out.

## Hoarding and memories

Hoarding is one of those things I feel like I would do given the opportunity. I don't know how to go about explaining it. I've always been a person that likes to see memories solidified or "tangified". The very idea of memories being tangible is paradoxical in itself, but I still want it. Right now, I have photos scattered all over the place (in photo albums, Google Photos, iCloud), a rose quartz from my travels in San Francisco [this summer](/article/general/2022-08-16-summer), stickers from [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com), at least four cards I've received from people over the last few years, and a few (useless) medals. 

I've been keeping these carefully tucked away. But when I was a kid, I hated memories. I hated being in photos (and I still do). I was scared of being embarrassed by what I saw. I was scared of not being able to compare to other people's picture-perfect pictures. My elementary school yearbook has rust on it now, from being thrown in the back of a garage. That's how embarrassed I was by my picture. But there was nothing wrong with it. At all.

And now, as I grow older, I find myself wanting pictures of every single trip I've ever been on.

## Being ultra

I recently read [this](https://notebook.lachlanjc.com/2019-09-24_lachlan_ultra) from a prior Hack Club member about being "ultra" - about being out, bold, and proud. So here's how I feel ultra. I feel ultra when I'm wearing my wacky, messy Converse shoes, and my slightly crumpled cardigan. I feel ultra building stuff that I can use to express myself, like this blog. I feel ultra listening to Taylor Swift, Conan Gray, and whatever I happen to be listening to at the moment; it doesn't matter if I jump all over the place when it comes to listening to music. I don't have to share anybody else's styles, because they're not mine.

Being ultra is more than about being out, loud, and proud. It's about feeling comfortable. I always thought I was a bit weird; I never fit in with other kids my age. It's only been recently that I've started embracing this weirdness and seeing it as a more endearing trait. I've started appreciating the fact that I have wacky tastes - I loved Pokemon, Star Wars, and Scooby-Doo when I was a kid - and I still do. I've started appreciating the fact that I **can** and like to start conversations with something random (literally - if someone wants to talk with me - I'll pull out my phone and ask if they want to see seals, and launch into a spiel about San Francisco and living in Brooklyn and all sorts of things), and that I'm even better at listening, which I know people appreciate.

## Damn it, smile if you want to.

I remember talking to someone this summer. He was constantly smiling, even when nobody was paying attention to him. At first, I thought he was just a weirdo, I'm not going to lie. How would laugh out of the blue while looking at his phone, or when making eye contact with someone? He tried to get me to listen to his music (I'm not exactly the biggest fan of Nicki Minaj.) But everybody loved him for his big, bold, friendly personality.

I thought he was annoying at first. But after he asked me if I had social anxiety, I realized that I was actually jealous of what he had - a sort of freedom with everyone. He gave me one piece of advice - to just put myself out there. (Which meant he physically dragged me around to say "Hi" to everyone.) 

And you know what? It's been really positive for my social anxiety. It's not about smiling all the time. It's about smiling if I want to, being sour if I want to, whatever. As long as I'm openly feeling.

## For the Taylor lovers...

Okay, so here's what I think about Taylor's new album. It's a nice early Christmas gift, but could be better - *compared to her other albums*. Compared to other music that has come out recently, her music is a godsend.

People have been saying that it's a combo of *1989* + *Reputation* + *Lover*. Here's how people have described it, paraphrased because I couldn't find the source:

> *Midnights* is basically the poppy feel of *1989* combined with the middle finger of *Reputation* and the heart of *Lover*.

To me, this is both an advantage and a disadvantage. See, *1989*, *Reputation*, and *Lover* all do one thing right: *1989* for its amazing pop feels (fine, I'll acknowledge that I literally grew up listening to just *1989*, so of course, it's my favorite album), *Reputation* for its ability to empower, and *Lover* for just being wild and wacky. *Midnights* is nice nostalgia, but it lacks what *1989*, *Reputation*, and *Lover* have - a sense of uniqueness. Regardless, it's still pretty great, and I've been listening to it on repeat.
