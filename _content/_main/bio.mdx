Hey! I'm Jianmin Chen. I typically go by a variation of my name online - that is, "jchen" or "jianmin-chen" or "jc" or "jianminchen". (And counting, depending on whether my name's been taken or not. It's surprising how a rare name like mine's can be so common). In real life, I go by "Amanda" since most people have trouble pronouncing my name. I put the pro in procrastinator by working on multiple projects at any given time and pretending like I'll definitely be able to finish them. In my free time, I also love playing the guitar (note: should probably start playing more often, quite frankly), reading (I read a lot), running (I normally run a lot, although this summer I've been biking more - around 6~ miles a day to and from work), and stressing over the smallest things (no, I don't have a rubber duck to stress and debug with me). You can catch me at the following places:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/jianmin-chen)
* [Hack Club scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/jc)
* [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/13M4FKrzemk1gN0tLaT7u5?si=bd840744c1c04a40)

I refuse to sign up for any social media websites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) unless I have actual reasons for doing so (i.e., business-related), so you won't find me anywhere on those ~~lovely~~ not-so-lovely places. It's just a me thing, I guess.

Now that I've started talking about myself, I should probably talk a little more. (Trust me, I'm less talkative in real life.) I discovered programming when I found an awesome book called [Python for Kids](https://nostarch.com/python-kids-2nd-edition) at my local library. (I've since moved, but Brooklyn is an awesome place.) Programming is basically my favorite pastime (I don't know if it can be considered a pastime anymore), as long as I don't feel pressured to do it. (I think not enjoying being pressured to do something applies to a lot of things, but especially learning. Take that, public school system!) (Yes, I also procrastinate when it comes to finishing schoolwork/homework/whatever you call it).

Anyways, I love tech in general, so a pretty large chunk of my day is spent doing something tech-related, like:

* Programming, obviously: Mostly full-stack web development, but I'm interested in getting involved in other fields. Like I said before, I love every aspect of technology. Sadly, time exists.
* Geeking over computers: I'm planning to learn more about the inner workings soon with [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), but mostly IT stuff at this point

Okay, that's enough about me.
